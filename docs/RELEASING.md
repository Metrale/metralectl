# Releasing

`metralectl` ships to three places from one pipeline: GitHub Releases (the
`curl | sh` installer), crates.io, and PyPI.

## How a release happens

Merges to `main` do not publish. release-please maintains a standing
"Release vX.Y.Z" pull request, and **merging that PR is the release**. Merging
it tags, builds, and publishes everything since the last one.

That reconciles "merging to main ships" with the fact that crates.io versions
are immutable. Recipe edits — which are this repository's main traffic — land on
`main` immediately and are visible to the website, and they accumulate in the
pending release PR rather than burning a version each.

Commit titles decide the version, so they must be conventional commits:
`feat:` for a minor bump, `fix:` for a patch, `feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:`
footer for a major. The repository squash-merges, so the PR title becomes the
commit message.

### The release PR's checks do not start on their own

release-please pushes its branch as a bot, and this repository requires manual
approval before workflows run for it. So the release PR sits with **one** check
(GitGuardian, which is not an Actions workflow) and everything else absent —
which reads exactly like a slow queue, and waits indefinitely.

They are waiting for a person:

```sh
gh run list --branch release-please--branches--main --json databaseId,name,conclusion
# conclusion "action_required" means it never started
gh api -X POST repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs/<id>/approve
```

Approve them and the checks run normally. Every merge to `main` regenerates the
branch, and the new runs need approving again — so approve **last**, once the
release PR is the change you actually intend to ship.

The tell is the check count. A release PR showing one check has not started; a
release PR showing a dozen is genuinely running.

## What publishes, and how it authenticates

| Target | Job | Credential |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Release (tarballs, checksums, `install.sh`) | `github-release` | the run's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| crates.io | `publish-crates` | Trusted Publishing (OIDC), environment `crates-io` |
| PyPI (`metralectl`) | `publish-pypi` | Trusted Publishing (OIDC), environment `pypi` |

No long-lived registry token is used. Each publish job mints a short-lived one
from its own OIDC identity, and both environments are restricted to `main` and
`v*` tags, so a feature branch cannot reach them.

Both publish steps are idempotent — crates check the index first, PyPI uses
`skip-existing` — so re-running a partially failed release is safe.

## The distribution names

The crate, the binary and the PyPI distribution are all `metralectl`. Because
the distribution and its console script share that name, `uvx metralectl`
finds the executable without `--from`, and `uv tool install metralectl` puts
`metralectl` on your PATH.

## Recipes are part of the binary

Recipes are compiled in, so **a recipe change only reaches users when a release
ships**. That is the security property, not an oversight: there is no remote
registry to redirect and nothing fetched at runtime. The website reads recipes
from git, so it reflects `main` immediately either way.

The workspace root is itself a package (`metrale-recipes-data`) for this reason —
`cargo package` only includes files beneath the crate root, so a crate under
`crates/` could not embed `../../recipes` and still work when installed from
crates.io.

## If the pipeline is broken

`.github/workflows/bootstrap-publish.yml` publishes to crates.io with a stored
token instead of OIDC. It is manual-dispatch only, dry-runs by default, and
requires a typed confirmation. It exists because the *first* publish of a crate
cannot use Trusted Publishing — a crate must exist before a publisher can be
attached to it — and is kept afterwards only as a recovery path. Delete it, and
revoke `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`, once `release.yml` has published cleanly at least
once.

### A release left hidden

A release is created as a **prerelease** and promoted once its assets are
attached, so that `releases/latest` — which `install.sh` resolves — keeps
serving the previous, complete release while the matrix builds. If the run dies
between those two points, the new release stays hidden.

That is the safer of the two failures: installs go on working. It is also loud,
because `verify-published` asserts the end state and fails the run.

**The recovery dispatch does not un-hide it, deliberately.** Re-running
`release.yml` with a `tag` input uploads assets but leaves `cut=false`, so it
neither hides nor promotes — that guard is what stops a recovery of an OLD tag
dragging `releases/latest` backwards onto it. The trade is that a stuck release
needs one manual step:

```sh
id=$(gh api repos/:owner/:repo/releases/tags/vX.Y.Z --jq .id)
gh api -X PATCH repos/:owner/:repo/releases/$id -F prerelease=false -f make_latest=true
```

Do that only when the release genuinely has its assets — check first, because
un-hiding an empty one recreates the 404 the hiding exists to prevent:

```sh
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/releases/tags/vX.Y.Z --jq '.assets|length'
```

## Version history baseline

Tag `v0.1.0` at the commit the bootstrap workflow publishes from, because that
publish does not tag.

This matters: release-please computes the next version from commits **since the
last tag**. Without it, the first release PR proposed 0.2.0 and swept every
historical recipe commit into the changelog, because it had no baseline to
compare against.

## Verifying a release

```sh
cargo install metralectl --locked      # from crates.io
uvx metralectl list                  # from PyPI, no install step
curl -fsSL https://dev.metrale.ai/install.sh | sh
```

The installer verifies SHA-256 against the release, and verifies Sigstore build
provenance too when `gh` is present. A `smoke-install` job runs the published
one-liner on both architectures before anyone follows the website's
instructions.
