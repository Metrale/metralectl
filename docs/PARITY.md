# Parity with the reference implementation

metralectl replaces the Python `sparkrun` launcher. The risk in that kind of
rewrite is not a loud failure — it is a *plausible* command that quietly
differs from the one every published benchmark was measured under. This
document records what was checked, what matches, and what deliberately does not.

## Serve commands: 28/28 byte-identical when measured

Every launchable recipe the corpus then held was rendered by both
implementations and compared byte-for-byte:

- **metralectl**: `translate()` under a fixed host snapshot, as frozen in
  `crates/metralectl-core/tests/golden/`.
- **sparkrun 0.3.6**: `sparkrun run <recipe> --hosts localhost --dry-run`,
  taking the printed `Serve command:` line.

All 28 matched exactly — same flags, same values, same order. Multi-node
recipes were compared on their head rank, since sparkrun's dry run prints the
base command without per-rank coordination flags.

sparkrun names the engine binary differently from `met`, so the two agree on
every byte after the binary name.

That comparison cannot be re-run on the current corpus. Its 30 launchable
recipes declare `runtime: metrale`, which sparkrun 0.3.6 has no runtime for,
and they use serve flags its tables do not know (`--scheduler`,
`--tool-grammar`, the bare boolean flags). The reference now is the engine's
own serve CLI: `vendor/serve-options.v2.json` is reflected out of it,
`flags::coverage` fails the build when the flag table and that snapshot
disagree, and `crates/metralectl-core/tests/golden/` freezes the argv
metralectl renders for every launchable recipe.

```sh
cargo test -p metralectl-core --test golden
```

## Deliberate divergences

These are intended and reviewed. Each is a behaviour change, not an accident.

### The container is launched in one phase, not two

sparkrun runs `docker run … sleep infinity` and then `docker exec`s the serve
command into it, so that `pre_exec` hooks have somewhere to run. metralectl does
not support hooks, so it emits a single self-contained `docker run` that ends
in `met serve …`.

Consequences, all of them improvements:

- the string we print is exactly what executes, so the copy button and the
  agent cannot disagree;
- `docker logs` shows serve output — under sparkrun PID 1 is `sleep`, so it
  does not;
- `--restart` restarts the model rather than a sleeping process;
- container exit equals serve exit, so status is truthful.

The cost: with `--rm`, a crashed serve removes its own logs. sparkrun's sleeping
container survived to be inspected.

### Recipe-supplied code is refused, not executed

`pre_exec`, `post_exec`, `post_commands`, `stop_after_post`, `mods`, `builder`
and `builder_config` are recognised and refused. `executor_config` is refused
too: container isolation comes from one reviewed profile, never from a recipe.

A recipe carrying any of them still *loads*, so `recipe list` and `recipe show`
can explain why it will not run. Two recipes in this repository are affected —
both `diffusion-gemma` files, which use `mods`.

### Only the `metrale` runtime launches

sparkrun infers a runtime for legacy recipes by inspecting their command
template. metralectl does not guess what to execute; a recipe with no `runtime:`
is listed and explained rather than launched.

### Settings the flag table does not claim are reported

Both implementations emit only the flags in their table, so unclaimed recipe
settings do not reach `met serve`. sparkrun drops them in silence; metralectl
reports every one.

This was not hypothetical. Nine settings in this repository were affected,
including `lm_head_dtype`, which five recipes now set and one describes
as a correctness pin. None had ever reached the engine.

All nine are now claimed, and the reconciliation that made that safe is
`vendor/serve-options.v2.json` — the engine's own clap definition, reflected out
of `met dump-serve-options`. `flags::coverage` fails the build when a flag in
it is neither claimed by the table nor listed in `EXCLUDED` with a reason, so a
new engine flag can no longer join the dropped set by simply appearing.

The snapshot settled a question a transcription could not. `video_allow_ffmpeg:
true` and `gdn_fused_norm: true` are written identically in YAML and once
emitted differently — `--video-allow-ffmpeg` bare, `--gdn-fused-norm true` —
and only the engine knew which was which. The engine has since made every
boolean a bare flag (settings it can pin either way take `auto`, `on` or
`off`), and the regenerated snapshot is what carried that change here. It also caught two bounds this project had
invented that its own recipes violated: `request_timeout` was `1..=86400` while
a shipping recipe sets `0` (which the engine documents as disabling the
deadline), and `max_batch_size` was `1..=64` while a shipping recipe sets `128`.
Both would have shown up as the web form rejecting a value from the recipe it
was displaying.

48 engine flags remain unclaimed, each with a recorded reason — multi-node
bootstrap values metralectl derives itself, host paths, outbound-fetch switches,
diagnostic modes that do not serve, and flags no recipe has asked for.

### Aliased settings collide instead of double-emitting

`max_num_batched_tokens` and `max_prefill_tokens` both render
`--max-prefill-tokens`. sparkrun emits the flag twice when both are set;
metralectl rejects the config. No recipe here sets both.

## What is not yet covered

The comparison above is of *serve commands*. The docker wrapper differs by
design (single-phase, argv rather than `bash -c`), so it is not compared
mechanically. Multi-node behaviour beyond command rendering — rendezvous,
per-rank orchestration, fabric selection — is not yet implemented and therefore
not yet compared.
