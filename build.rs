//! Tell cargo that the embedded recipes are an input.

//! `src/lib.rs` embeds `recipes/` with `include_dir!`, which cargo cannot see:
//! it tracks `.rs` files, not what a macro reads. So adding, editing or deleting
//! a recipe left a STALE `metrale-recipes-data` in the build cache, and every
//! consumer kept the old set.
//!
//! That is not a theoretical staleness. It means `cargo test` passes on a
//! machine that has built before and fails in CI, which builds clean -- the
//! worst direction for a check to be wrong in, because the person who added the
//! recipe sees green and the reviewer sees red. It cost exactly that on the
//! Flash-Next recipe: the golden test reported "no golden" on CI while blessing
//! it locally produced nothing at all, because the recipe was not in the crate
//! the test had linked against.
