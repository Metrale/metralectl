#
# The counterpart of scripts/install.sh, and deliberately the same SHAPE: same
# resolution of "latest", same refusal to install a binary whose checksum is
# not in SHA256SUMS, and the same three outcomes — fresh install, upgrade, or
# "already at this version, so start what is already here". Anyone comparing
# the two should find the arguments identical and only the syntax different.
#
# This script deliberately embeds no version. It always resolves what the
# release marked latest, so a stale copy of the script cannot pin an old
# release.
#
# To join a fleet at install time — the Windows counterpart of
# `curl … | sh -s -- --join <code>@<host>`:
#
#   & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://dev.metrale.ai/install.ps1))) -Join 12345678@10.0.0.1
#
# `irm | iex` cannot pass arguments; `[scriptblock]::Create` can, and is the
# idiom every Windows installer that takes options uses.

# `irm | iex` runs this in the CALLER'S SCOPE, so anything set here is still set
# in the operator's session afterwards. `$ErrorActionPreference` is saved and put
# back at the end for that reason: without it, a successful install silently left
# every later command in the window failing on the first non-terminating error.
$__metralePrevEap = $ErrorActionPreference
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'

# NOT `Set-StrictMode` here, for the same reason and one more: there is no way to
# read the caller's current strict mode, so it cannot be restored -- turning it
# off at the end would be a change in its own right for anyone who had it on. The
# test harness sets it before loading these functions, so the strictness this
# script is written under is still enforced where it can be observed, and not
# imposed on a session that did not ask for it.

# Deliberately NO `param()` block, and every option parsed by hand.
#
# `param([string]$Join, …)` makes `$Join` POSITIONAL, and PowerShell binds a
# `--anything` token to a positional parameter rather than treating it as a
# switch — so `--join CODE@HOST` bound `--join` itself to `$Join` and stranded
# the value, `--grant-control` alone BECAME the join target, and
# `--grant-control --join CODE@HOST` silently dropped the grant. The
# compatibility loop that was supposed to accept those spellings never saw
# them, because binding had already happened.
#
# With no param block, `$args` holds every token exactly as pasted and one
# parser handles both spellings. That matters because the shell installer, the
# docs and the site all say `--join`, and someone translating that line by hand
# will type it.
