"""Every internal version requirement must equal the package it points at.

With ``--fix``, rewrites them instead of complaining. The release workflow uses
that: release-please bumps ``[package] version`` and never touches the
requirements pointing at it, so on the release branch they are stale by
construction. Repairing them there is the same job as repairing the lock, and
it makes a split release harmless — each requirement gets the version of the
crate it actually names, whether or not the crates moved together.

Workspace members depend on each other by path *and* version, because
publishing to crates.io needs the version. Nothing in cargo keeps that
requirement in step with the package it names.

The drift is invisible while both sides are 0.1.x: `^0.1.2` resolves against
0.1.3 quite happily. It only bites when a release cuts a minor bump, because
`^0.1.2` means `>=0.1.2, <0.2.0` — so 0.2.0 cannot satisfy it and the release
job dies with `failed to select a version for the requirement`, *after* the
release PR is open and looking healthy. That blocked every release attempt on
2026-08-26, and it hid in five separate places.

This parses TOML rather than grepping. The first version of this check used a
regex that assumed `path` came before `version` and only read the workspace
root, and it sailed straight past

    metralectl-protocol = { version = "0.1.2", path = "../metralectl-protocol" }

in a member crate. Key order is not semantic in TOML, and a check that depends
on it is a check that lies.

The same reasoning covers .release-please-manifest.json: release-please
computes the next version from that file, not from the manifests on disk, so a
stale entry there gives one crate a different bump from the rest — which is
what split the release into 0.2.0 and 0.1.4 and defeated linked-versions.
