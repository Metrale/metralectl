# Tests for scripts/install.ps1 — the `irm … | iex` one-liner.
#
# The counterpart of install-sh.test.sh, over the same three decisions: which
# target, whether a downloaded binary may be executed, and what to do about an
# agent that may or may not already be there. Written without Pester so it runs
# on a bare windows-latest with nothing installed.
#
# The script's functions are loaded by taking everything ABOVE its `# --- main`
# marker and evaluating that, rather than by adding a "do not run when dot
# sourced" guard to install.ps1. A hook that exists only for tests is
# test-specific code in a production path; this file is where that cost belongs.

# The shipped script no longer sets this itself: `irm | iex` runs in the caller's
# scope and it cannot be restored. The strictness the script is WRITTEN under is
# enforced here instead, where it costs no one their session.
