//! This machine, acting as one rank of somebody else's cluster.
//!
//! The head never renders another machine's command. It does not know which
//! recipe revision that machine has, what its flag table claims, or what
//! hardware it is exposing — so a preview the head invented would be a guess
//! presented as the thing that will execute. Each rank answers for itself,
//! through the same `translate()` the launcher uses, so preview and execution
//! cannot drift.
//!
//! ## The reservation
//!
//! `prepare` renders the command and *keeps it*. `commit` runs what was kept,
//! and takes only an epoch. So the bytes that reach the container runtime were
//! produced by this machine, from its own recipe, before the head was told
//! anything — a head compromised between the two phases can start the launch
//! the operator already previewed, or not start it, and nothing else.
//!
//! One reservation at a time, deliberately. A machine that has agreed to be
//! rank 1 of one cluster must refuse to be rank 1 of another, or the second
//! commit would silently replace the first cluster's container mid-launch.
