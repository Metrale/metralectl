//! `metralectl bench` — run a certification gate on a paired node.
//!
//! Every subcommand takes `--json` and then writes exactly one JSON document
//! to stdout (NDJSON, one event per line, for `attach` and `run`) and nothing
//! else there, so a caller such as `met bench certify` parses stdout and
//! never the log. Failures under `--json` are an `ErrorObj` on stdout with a
//! distinct exit code per class; see [`crate::commands::bench::exit`].
