//! Where metralectl keeps its state, and what to say when it cannot.
//!
//! Three files live here and they are **one unit**: `browser.token` pairs a
//! browser, `agent.key` is this node's identity, and `peers.json` is who it
//! trusts. Splitting them is never useful and is actively harmful — moving the
//! directory to dodge a permission problem silently reissues the identity and
//! drops every pin, so the node comes back as a stranger to its own fleet.
//! That is why the override below relocates all three together and why
//! `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is documented as the wrong tool for the job.
//!
//! The diagnosis half exists because the failure this replaces was
//! `Permission denied (os error 13)` and nothing else. That is true and
//! useless: it names neither the reason (a directory owned by another user)
//! nor either remedy. An error an operator cannot act on is a bug report they
//! have to write instead.
