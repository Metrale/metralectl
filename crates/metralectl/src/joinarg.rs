//! Parsing the `--join` argument an operator pastes on a new machine.

//! The whole invitation arrives as one token — `12345678@10.10.10.1` — because
//! it is meant to be copied in a single motion from a browser to a terminal,
//! usually on a different machine. Two separate flags would double the chance

//! Pure, so the shapes that fail are testable without a network. They matter
