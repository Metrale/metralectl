//! Installing the agent so it is there after a reboot.
//!
//! The website's whole premise is that a machine you own is reachable from a
//! page you did not have to trust. That only holds if the agent is running, and
//! an agent started by hand in a terminal stops being there the moment the
//! terminal closes — which is not a fleet, it is a demo.
//!
//! Everything with a decision in it lives in [`plan`], which is pure. This file
//! is the I/O: write the unit, run the commands, report what happened. Both the
//! filesystem and the process runner are injected, so the orderings that matter
//! — reload before enable, disable before delete — are tested without a
//! systemd anywhere near the test.
//!
//! **This does not raise privilege.** The unit is a `systemd --user` unit and
//! the plist a LaunchAgent; both run as the installing user. Nothing here is
//! written to a system path and nothing asks for root. That is deliberate: the
//! agent already has docker access, which on Linux is root-equivalent, and a
//! root-owned service on top of that would widen a surface that is quite wide
//! enough.
