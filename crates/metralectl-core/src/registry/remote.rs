//! Remote registries: opt-in, and never trusted.
//!
//! A remote registry supplies recipe *data* and nothing else. There is no
//! `trusted` field in this module or in the config it reads — the mechanism
//! does not exist, so no configuration edit and no upstream change can enable
//! it. Recipes from a remote pass through exactly the same loader as built-in
//! ones, which refuses executable-content keys outright.
