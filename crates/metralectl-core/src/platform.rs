//! The handful of facts that differ per operating system.
//!
//! Every one of these was a bare `std::env::var("HOME")` scattered through the
//! CLI. Collected here because they are not independent: the config directory,
//! the cache directory and the home directory must agree about which user this
//! is, and a port that fixes them one call site at a time gets that wrong in a
//! way nothing fails on until a node comes back as a stranger to its own fleet.

//! State goes under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, never `%APPDATA%`. The difference is
//! roaming: `%APPDATA%` follows a user between machines on a domain, and
//! `agent.key` is *this machine's* identity. Roaming it would give two machines
//! the same node identity — the same failure as sharing a private key, arrived
//! at by copying a directory.
