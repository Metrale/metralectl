//! Writing and checking the files nobody else may read.
//!
//! Three files qualify: `browser.token` pairs a browser, `agent.key` is this
//! node's private identity, and anything derived from them. They had two
//! separate implementations of "write this privately" — one in `token`, one in
//! `identity` — which is one implementation too many for a rule that has to
//! hold everywhere.
//!
//! # What "private" means per platform
//!
//! On unix it is a mode: `0600` at creation, verified on read. The mode is set
//! *at* creation rather than chmod-ed after, so the secret never exists at the
//! ambient umask, however briefly.
//!
//! On Windows there is no mode, and inventing one would be theatre. Protection
//! comes from the directory: `%LOCALAPPDATA%` carries an inherited ACL granting
//! the owning user, SYSTEM and Administrators — the same trust boundary as
//! `~/.config` at `0700`, where root reads everything too. A new file inherits
//! that ACL, so writing normally is writing privately.
//!
//! What that does *not* cover is a secret written somewhere else, which is
//! reachable: `--config-dir` takes any path the operator names, and a network
//! share or `C:\ProgramData` is world-readable. So the Windows check is
//! containment — the secret must live under this user's profile. It is a
//! weaker statement than the unix mode check and is deliberately not dressed
//! up as an equivalent one; a DACL walk that would also catch a hand-widened
//! ACL on the profile itself is left for when there is a reason to believe
//! that happens.
