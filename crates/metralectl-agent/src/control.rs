//! The single execution core for the seven single-node control operations.
//!
//! Extracted from the session so it has exactly two callers: the browser
//! session's local verbs, and the peer channel's terminal `Control` handler.
//! One core is the point — a second, less-checked execution path is how a
//! relayed launch skips schema validation, the `can_launch` gate, or the
//! log-line cap that the local path enforces. Everything here is I/O-free
//! except through the injected [`Launcher`] and [`LaunchTelemetry`] ports
//! (SBIO), so both callers stay testable without a container runtime.
