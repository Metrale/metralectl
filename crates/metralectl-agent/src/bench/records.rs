//! Which records did THIS job write?
//!
//! Split from `ports_std` because it answers a question of its own, and because
//! answering it wrongly is expensive: on 2026-09-17 the previous job's record
//! was handed back with this one's, the submitter refused the pair, and a
//! 27-minute shard was lost. The answer is a difference against a snapshot
//! taken immediately before the child starts — never "everything modified since
//! a wall-clock instant".
