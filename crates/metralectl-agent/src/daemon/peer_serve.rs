//! Serving a pinned peer's frames, split from `daemon.rs` for size.
//!
//! The seam is the dispatch boundary: `daemon.rs` owns listeners, spawn
//! loops and lifecycle, and this file owns what a frame from an
//! already-authenticated pinned peer is answered with — the rank verbs, the
//! terminal `Control` executor (rules T1–T4) and the `ControlTo` relay
//! (rules R1–R6).
//!
//! The no-nesting rule is structural here, not checked: [`terminal_control`]
//! has no dialer, no fleet and no address book in scope, so code that
//! forwards from inside it cannot be written without changing its signature
//! in review; and [`relay_control`] is the only place that dials, and the
//! only frame it ever writes onward is the terminal `Control` — which itself
//! cannot name anywhere further to go.
