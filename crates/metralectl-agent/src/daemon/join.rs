    // ⚠ The cost of that choice, which is real and not yet paid: this charges
    // for a CONNECTION, not for a guess at the code. Unpair is one-sided by
    // design (`fleet/listing.rs`), so a machine we removed still pins us and its
    // link poller keeps dialing every five seconds. Outside a window those
    // handshakes are refused cheaply — but the moment a human mints a join code,
    // that poller's next three connections complete the handshake, land here,
    // and spend the whole budget in about fifteen seconds. Every "add a machine"
    // afterwards fails with "that invitation was already used", forever, and
    // nothing names the ex-peer as the cause.

    // attempted the PAIRING protocol — a non-pairing first frame is not a guess
    // — which means reading and classifying that frame before `pair::run` owns
