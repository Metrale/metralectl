//! The window in which this machine will accept a new member.
//!
//! Pairing has always required a human, and it still does — what changes here
//! is *which* machine they are standing at. The original ceremony mints the
//! code on the machine being added, which proves someone walked over to it.
//! That is unusable from a browser: the operator is at the laptop, and the
//! thing they are adding is a headless box they may not have a screen for.
//!
//! So the direction inverts. The laptop mints, the human carries the code in
//! the command they paste on the other machine, and the ceremony runs with the
//! roles swapped. The security property is unchanged in the part that matters:
//! **a web page still cannot pair with anything on its own**, because the code
//! has to physically reach another machine, and only a human can do that.
//!
//! What the inversion does cost is that the code now sits in a shell history,
//! so the window is deliberately small and answers to all three of:
//!
//!   * an expiry, so an abandoned invitation closes itself;
//!   * single use, so a code that worked cannot work twice;
//!   * an attempt limit, so it cannot be guessed inside its own lifetime.
//!
//! 8 digits is 10^8; at three attempts per window that is not a space worth
//! searching, and the limiter closes the window rather than merely refusing —
//! there is no value in leaving a partially-guessed code alive.
