//! What this machine will do when another machine asks it to be a rank.
//!
//! One trait rather than four, because these calls are one lifecycle and share
//! one piece of state — the reservation. Splitting them would let a caller hold
//! `prepare` from one implementation and `commit` from another, which is
//! exactly the mistake the two-phase protocol exists to prevent.
//!
//! ## Why commit carries only an epoch
//!
//! [`RankService::commit`] takes no assignment. It runs the command this
//! machine rendered and stored during [`prepare`](RankService::prepare), from
//! its own recipe, under its own settings validation. A head that is
//! compromised between the two phases therefore cannot substitute anything:
//! the worst it can do is start the launch the operator already previewed, or
//! not start it. That property is the entire reason the protocol has two
//! phases rather than one, and it is why the assignment must not be resent.
//!
//! Every method is infallible-by-return rather than by panic. A rank that
//! cannot answer is an ordinary state of a fleet — a machine gets switched off
//! mid-ceremony — and the head's rollback path is what handles it.
