//!
//! The policy exists because picking naively goes wrong in a way that is

//! `dummy0` carrying the documented head IP, wifi, and four RoCE ports on
//! point-to-point /30s. Taking the first address with a carrier gives you a
//! docker bridge; taking the first routable one gives you wifi. Either runs the
//! collective over the wrong link and costs multiples of throughput while every
//! correctness check still passes.
