//! Planning and committing a launch that spans several machines.
//!
//! Two properties are load-bearing, and both are enforced by the types rather
//! than by care.
//!
//! **No agent ever runs an argv it was handed.** A [`RankAssignment`] carries a
//! recipe id, a rank, a world size, a rendezvous address and bounded scalar
//! settings — and nothing else. Each worker renders its own docker command
//! locally, from its own vendored copy of the recipe. The blast radius of a
//! compromised head is therefore "start one of the recipes this machine already
//! ships, with in-range parameters", which is annoying rather than fatal.
//!
//! **There is never a partial cluster.** Prepare asks every rank to validate
//! and reserve; a single refusal aborts every rank that accepted. Commit only
//! runs once every rank is prepared under the same epoch, so a stale prepare
//! cannot be committed against a plan that has since changed.
//!
//! The planning half is pure, so the awkward cases — a head with no usable
//! link, a fleet where only one node can launch, ranks that disagree about the
//! recipe — are unit-testable with no network and no hardware.
