//! The pairing ceremony: turning "I can see that machine" into "I trust it".
//!
//! A short numeric code is all a human will actually transcribe, and a short
//! code sent over a channel is trivially guessable offline. SPAKE2 fixes that:
//! it turns a low-entropy shared secret into a strong shared key, and gives an
//! attacker exactly **one online guess per attempt** rather than an offline
//! dictionary. Wrong guesses are therefore rate-limitable, and they are
//! rate-limited.
//!
//! **The code always originates on the target machine.** Someone runs
//! `metralectl agent pair` on the box they want to add, and reads the digits off
//! that screen. This is what makes a hostile web page harmless: it cannot know
//! a code it did not cause a human to walk over and read.
//!
//! **The TLS exporter is mixed into the transcript.** This is the part that
//! actually defeats a machine-in-the-middle. An attacker who terminates two
//! separate TLS sessions and relays between them ends up with two *different*
//! exporter secrets, so the confirmation MACs do not match on either side, key
//! confirmation fails, and no pin is written. Without that binding, SPAKE2
//! would authenticate the endpoints while an attacker sat happily between two
//! authenticated connections.
