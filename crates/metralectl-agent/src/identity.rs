//! This agent's cryptographic identity, and the peers it has decided to trust.
//!
//! Identity is an Ed25519 keypair generated once on first run and kept at
//! `0600`. Its [`NodeId`] is the SHA-256 of the public key. That indirection is
//! what lets the peer channel pin a *key* rather than a certificate: certs
//! expire and get regenerated, and a pairing that broke every time a cert
//! rolled over would train people to re-pair without checking, which is the
//! whole ceremony defeated.
//!
//! Trust is a pin file: a peer this machine has completed the pairing ceremony
//! with. Discovery does not write here. Only pairing does, and only after key
//! confirmation. Removing a pin takes effect on the next connection, because
//! every connection re-reads the store rather than caching a decision made at
//! startup.
