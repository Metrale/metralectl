//! The background work an agent does whether or not anyone is looking.
//!
//! Three loops, deliberately independent so one failing does not take the
//! others with it:
//!
//! * **Discovery** advertises this node and records what it hears. A network
//!   that filters multicast is a normal condition, not a fault — the loop says
//!   so once and stops, and `metralectl peer add` remains a first-class path.
//! * **Vitals** samples this machine and pushes the result to anyone watching.
//!   It is what makes an idle node's clamped clock or full disk visible before
//!   someone launches on it.
//! * **Pruning** ages out sightings so a node that left the network stops being
//!   listed as present, while a *paired* node stays listed as unreachable —
//!   because it is still part of your fleet when it is switched off.
//!
//! Every loop is cancellation-safe and holds only an `Arc`, so shutting the
//! agent down does not need any of them to cooperate.
