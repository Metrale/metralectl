//! Driving a cluster launch from the head.
//!
//! The head plans — which machines, which ranks, which rendezvous address — and
//! then asks. It does not render another machine's command, because it does not
//! know that machine's recipe revision, flag table or hardware. Preview and
//! execution therefore come from the same code on the same box, which is the
//! only way a preview can be trusted to be what runs.
//!
//! Rank 0 is served locally for exactly the same reason: the head *is* the
//! machine that would run rank 0. It goes through the identical [`RankService`]
//! the peers expose, so there is no shorter, less-checked path for the machine
//! that happens to be holding the plan.
//!
//! ## Why two phases
//!
//! A single-phase launch has no way to fail cleanly. Start ranks one at a time
//! and the third machine's refusal leaves two containers running half a
//! cluster, waiting forever on a rendezvous that will never complete — and the
//! operator sees a hang, not an error. So every rank validates and reserves
//! first, and nothing starts until all of them have said yes.
//!
//! Both phases roll back. A refusal releases every reservation already taken; a
//! failed commit stops every rank already started, including rank 0. The
//! invariant is that a cluster is either whole or absent, never partial.
