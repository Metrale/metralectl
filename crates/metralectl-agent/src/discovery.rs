//! screen and can cause nothing else to happen: it cannot make this agent
//! connect anywhere privileged, cannot enter the pin store, and cannot launch
//! anything. Trust is established only by the pairing ceremony, which requires
//! a code read off the target machine by a human. That separation is why it is
//! safe to advertise by default.
//!
//! Everything in a beacon is therefore **untrusted input**, and is treated as
//! such at the boundary: names go through [`DisplayName`], and the record
//! deliberately carries no agent version (no scanning for a known-vulnerable
//! release), no recipe inventory, no running-job detail, and not the browser
//! control port.
//!
//! `metralectl peer add <host>` is a first-class path rather than a fallback.
//! Enterprise wifi does client isolation, plenty of switches filter multicast,
//! and the DGX RoCE links here are point-to-point /30s where multicast reaches
//! exactly one peer anyway.
