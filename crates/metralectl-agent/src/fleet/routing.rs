//! How a control verb reaches another machine.
//!
//! Split from `fleet.rs` (at the 500-line cap) along the routing seam: this
//! file answers "where would a control request for that node actually go",
//! from THIS agent's own state and nothing else. Both users of that answer —
//! the origin's relay driver and the listing's `reached_via` — resolve
//! through the same functions here and in [`super::vouched`], so the UI never
//! displays a route the router would not take (SSOT).
//!
//! Nothing in this file reads an address out of a frame or a digest. A
//! vouched address is display data; control reaches a vouched node ONLY
//! through its voucher, and a pinned node only at an address this agent's own
//! reports or pin store hold. That is what keeps a relay — and this agent —
//! from being used as an arbitrary-address proxy.
