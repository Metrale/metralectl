//! Turning what this agent knows into the list a browser renders.
//!
//! Split from [`super`] for size. The precedence it encodes is the whole point
//! and is worth stating plainly:
//!
//! 1. A **peer report** — something holding the key we pinned, said over the
//!    authenticated channel — wins outright. Its vitals and its link class are
//!    evidence.
//! 2. A **beacon sighting** places a machine and nothing more. Its link class is
//!    `Unverified`, never a guess, and it carries no vitals at all.
//! 3. A **pin with a remembered address** keeps a paired machine listed while it
//!    is switched off, because it is still part of your fleet when it is off.
//! 4. A **vouch** — a pinned peer's claim about a peer of ITS own — contributes
//!    a descriptor only when none of the first-hand tiers above know the node
//!    at all. It lists as [`PairingState::Vouched`] with `vouched_by` naming
//!    the claimant, because rendering a claim with the same face as evidence
//!    would lie to the operator about who verified what. When first-hand
//!    evidence exists, the vouch contributes exactly one thing: `vouched_by`
//!    as labeled corroboration. Fields are never blended across tiers.
//!
//! Anything seen but not pinned is listed, trusted by nobody, and shows no
//! vitals: telemetry from a machine you have not paired is not evidence about
//! your fleet.
