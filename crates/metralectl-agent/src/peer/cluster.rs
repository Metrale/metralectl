//! Asking another machine to be a rank.
//!
//! Every verb here dials, introduces itself, asks one question and hangs up.
//! There is no long-lived cluster session, deliberately: a session would have
//! to survive a switch reboot and a laptop lid closing to be worth anything,
//! and a head that reconnects per phase discovers a dead rank at the phase
//! boundary — which is exactly where the rollback path already is.
//!
//! Vitals are unsolicited, so a peer can offer one at any moment. Every reader
//! here skips them rather than mistaking one for an answer, bounded so that a
//! peer sending nothing else cannot hold a phase open.
