//! Dialling a machine and completing the pairing ceremony against it.
//!
//! Extracted so the two callers cannot drift. `metralectl peer add` runs this
//! from a terminal; the browser channel runs the same function through a port,
//! because a pairing driven from a web page and a pairing driven from a shell
//! must be the *same* exchange — the moment they are two implementations, one
//! of them is the weaker one and nobody knows which.
//!
//! Only the initiator side lives here. The responder is
//! [`super::pair::run`] with [`Role::Responder`], reached through the peer
//! listener.
//!
//! What authenticates this is the **code**, not the certificate: the peer is by
//! definition not pinned yet, so [`PinnedPeerVerifier::pairing`] accepts an
//! unknown certificate and SPAKE2 decides whether the other end knew the
//! secret. The TLS exporter is mixed into the confirmation transcript, so a
//! relay terminating two sessions produces two different exporters and fails
//! key confirmation on both sides — which is the property that makes it safe to
//! do this without a human comparing anything.
