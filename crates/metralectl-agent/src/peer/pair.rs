//! Driving the pairing ceremony across a real connection.
//!
//! [`crate::pairing`] owns the cryptography; this owns the conversation. The
//! split matters because the ordering is where these things go wrong, and the
//! ordering here is deliberate:
//!
//! 1. TLS completes first, with the verifier in its `pairing` mode — the peer
//!    is by definition not pinned yet, so the certificate check cannot be what
//!    authenticates it.
//! 2. Both sides export channel-binding material from **their own** TLS
//!    session.
//! 3. SPAKE2 messages are exchanged and each side derives a key.
//! 4. Confirmation MACs, computed over the key *and the binding*, are
//!    exchanged and checked in constant time.
//! 5. Only then is a pin written — and only after the caller has shown a human
//!    the verification words.
//!
//! Step 4 is what defeats a machine-in-the-middle. An attacker who terminates
//! two TLS sessions and relays between them holds two different exporters, so
//! the MACs disagree and both sides refuse. Without it, SPAKE2 would happily
//! authenticate both endpoints to an attacker sitting between two perfectly
//! authenticated connections.
