//! cannot be trusted to carry: the peer's real link class, its vitals, and
//! whether it is actually up.
//!
//! That last point is the important one. Liveness derived from beacons is
//! wrong in both directions — a machine can be broadcasting while its agent is
//! wedged, and a perfectly healthy machine can go quiet because a switch
//! filtered multicast. A peer is reachable when we can complete a mutually
//! authenticated handshake with it, and not otherwise.
//!
//! Failure here is ordinary. A peer that is switched off is the normal state of
//! a fleet, so a failed dial is recorded and retried with backoff rather than
//! logged as an error.
