//! Why the peer channel could not start.
//!
//! The old line said what had happened and what it cost — "could not bind
//! 34334: Address already in use … other machines will not be able to reach
//! this one" — and stopped one sentence short of the only thing the operator
//! can act on: WHO holds the port.
//!
//! In practice there is one answer. The peer port is not configurable on
//! `agent run`, so the holder is almost always this machine's other agent —
//! a service installed by `install.sh` plus a second copy started by hand,
//! which is a thing that happens the first time anyone experiments. The
//! browser port differs (it is a flag), so the second copy starts, serves a
//! page, and is silently unreachable by every other machine.
//!
//! Pure, so the wording is tested rather than discovered in the field.

/// The operator-facing reason the peer channel is off.
