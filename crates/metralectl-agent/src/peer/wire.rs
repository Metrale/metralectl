//! A **separate enum from `ClientMsg`**, on purpose. The browser surface and the
//! peer surface have different threat models and different authentication, and
//! sharing one enum between them is how a verb intended for a paired agent ends
//! up reachable from a web page. Keeping them apart makes that mistake require
//! writing the verb twice.
//!
//! Nothing here carries a command. The launch frame names a recipe and a rank;
//! the receiving agent renders its own docker command from its own vendored
//! copy. That is what bounds the damage a compromised head can do. The control
//! frames keep the same bound: `ControlReq` names recipes, never commands,
//! never containers it was not told about, and never another machine.
