//! TLS for the peer channel: mutual authentication, pinned to keys.
//!
//! The certificate is an envelope and nothing more. Both sides present a
//! self-signed certificate whose subject public key **is** the agent's Ed25519
//! identity key, and both sides verify their peer by hashing that key and
//! checking the fingerprint against the pin store. Expiry, subject names, and
//! chains of trust play no part: there is no CA, and there is deliberately no
//! way to add one.
//!
//! That choice is the point. The two obvious alternatives are worse:
//!
//! * A **locally generated root CA** installed into the OS trust store hands
//!   the machine a permanent, machine-wide interception capability that
//!   outlives this software and is only as safe as wherever its key ended up.
//!   That is the Superfish / eDellRoot failure, and shipping it to close a gap
//!   on a private link would be a net increase in the user's exposure.
//! * A **cluster CA** makes its private key a crown jewel with a distribution
//!   and rotation story nobody operates correctly, and buys no assurance over
//!   pinning the key you already verified by hand.
//!
//! Pinning the raw key also means a certificate may be regenerated freely — on
//! every boot, if we like — without breaking a single pairing. A trust model
//! that broke on cert rollover would train people to re-pair without checking
//! the fingerprint, which defeats the ceremony it exists to protect.
