//! The agent-to-agent channel.
//!
//! A second listener, on a second port, speaking a second protocol, with its
//! own authentication. That separation is the guarantee: the browser channel
//! never becomes network-reachable, and it is a property you can check with
//! `ss -tlnp` rather than one that depends on branching logic staying correct
//! through a refactor.
//!
//! Nothing here executes an argv it received. Peers exchange a typed
//! [`RankAssignment`]; each agent renders its own docker command locally from
//! its own vendored recipe. The blast radius of a compromised head is therefore
//! "launch one of the recipes this machine already has, with in-range
//! parameters", not remote code execution.
