//! Can this machine actually reach the address it has been told to meet at?
//!
//! A rank that cannot reach the rendezvous does not fail. It waits at the NCCL
//! barrier, retrying, for as long as the collective's timeout allows — and the
//! operator sees two containers running and no server. That happened on the
//! real pair: a DGX Spark carries four RoCE ports on separate point-to-point
//! `/30`s, the head offered its address on one of them, and the worker was
//! attached to a different one. `Connection timed out (os error 110), retrying`
//! every second, forever.
//!
//! So this is checked during prepare, where a refusal is cheap and says why,
//! rather than after commit, where it is a silent hang.
//!
//! Two questions, in order of confidence:
//!
//! 1. **Is it on a subnet I am directly attached to?** Exact, needs no network,
//!    and is the case that matters for point-to-point RoCE.
//! 2. **Does something answer there?** For anything routed, where subnet
//!    arithmetic cannot see the path. A refused connection proves the host is
//!    reachable just as well as an accepted one — better, since nothing is
//!    listening on the rendezvous port until rank 0 starts.
