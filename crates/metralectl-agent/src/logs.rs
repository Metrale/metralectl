//! The tail of a launch's log.
//!
//! Read for diagnosis, not as a data source. Every *number* this project shows
//! comes from the engine's `/metrics`; the log is what an operator reads when
//! something did not start, and nothing is parsed out of it. That split is
//! deliberate — the tool this replaces derived throughput from log text, and
//! every reword silently broke it.
//!
//! A log line is attacker-influenced text about to be rendered in a browser, so
//! it is sanitised here rather than at the point of display. Doing it once, at
//! the boundary, is what stops the next surface forgetting.
