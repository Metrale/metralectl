//! Reaching another machine, behind a trait.
//!
//! The cluster state machine decides *what* to ask each rank and, more
//! importantly, what to undo when a rank says no. That logic is where a partial
//! cluster comes from, so it is the part that has to be testable — and it
//! cannot be, if asking a rank means opening a socket.
//!
//! So the driver takes one of these instead. Production passes an
//! implementation that dials the authenticated peer channel; tests pass one
//! that records calls and answers from a table, and the rollback paths can then
//! be driven through every ordering that matters without two machines, two
//! TLS stacks and a network.
