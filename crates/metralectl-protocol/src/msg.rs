//!
//! The set of client messages *is* the capability surface. There is no
//! raw-command verb, no nested-message verb, and no relay of opaque bytes,
//! and the enum is closed — an unknown `type` fails deserialization rather
//! than reaching a handler. One scoped exception exists and is stated here
//! so the code cannot outgrow its own doctrine: the seven single-node
//! control verbs carry an optional `on` target, which an agent honors by
//! re-issuing the request AS ITSELF over its authenticated peer channel —
//! one hop, only toward a machine the forwarding agent has itself pinned
//! AND whose pin of the requester carries the explicit `controller` grant,
//! and only within the closed [`ControlReq`] vocabulary, which cannot express
//! pairing, joining, cluster reservation, or a further hop. Forwarding is an
//! annotation on closed verbs, never a wrapper around arbitrary messages:
//! that is what still keeps the agent from becoming an open proxy for
//! whatever page is talking to it.
